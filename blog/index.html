                <h3>Aids in Weight-loss Efforts</h3>
                The fat content in coconut water is extremely low, so generous quantities can be consumed without the fear of
                immediately packing on the pounds.
                <h3>Picture-Perfect Skin</h3>
                For those with acne or other blemishes on the surface of the skin, topical application of coconut water can go a
                great distance as it has the ability to clear up and subsequently tone the skin.
                <h3>The Ultimate Hangover Remedy</h3>
                Next time you over do it and drink more than you can handle , consume coconut water to settle your stomach
                <h3>Facilitates Digestion</h3>
                If you constantly encounter difficulty with digestion , coconut water may provide a source of relief
                <h3>Boosts Hydration</h3>
                The ingredients in coconut water are way more effective at hydrating the human body than those of sports energy
                drinks. During rigorous exercise or extended periods of physical activity, the human body loses mineral rich
                fluids.
                <h3>Reduces Blood Pressure</h3>

                water contains an adequate supply of each , it can be used as a balancing mechanism
                <h3>Rich In Nutrients</h3>
                Unlike any other beverage on the market , coconut water contains live essential electrolytes that are present in
                the human body
                <h3>Helps Fight Common Infections</h3>
                Due to the high mineral content , potassium and alkaline nature , coconut makes a very effective antimicrobial
                agent

                <h3>Is a great drink for people suffering from Diabetes</h3>

                in the
                journal of Phytochemistry, flavors present in sugarcane juice are highly effective in stopping the production
                and spread
                of cancerous cells.
                <h3>Beats dehydration</h3>
                The summer heat and the high amount of humidity make one prone to dehydration
                <h3>Helps your kidney</h3>function better and beats urinary tract infections
                Sugarcane juice has a large amount of proteins that help your kidneys function optimally

                <h3>Keeps your liver healthy</h3>
                Known to keep your bilirubin levels in check , this is one of the reasons the juice is used to treat Jaundice in practices such as Ayurveda
                Acts as an effective digestive agent
